A topic that has always interested me is "web scraping" (aka "screen scraping").  Ryan Mitchell in his book,
**Web Scraping with Python**, writes:

_In theory, web scraping is the practice of gathering data through any means other than a program interacting
with an API (or, obviously, through a human using a web browser)._

**_Yes, please!_**  This directory includes a collection of fiddles (aka "pens") focusing on python.  The examples
from Mitchell's book will serve as a starting point.
