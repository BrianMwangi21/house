= Docker

[Digging around in the angular-cli github repo recently I found an interesting
markdown (*.md) file entitled link:http://three-bradyhouse.rhcloud.com/?p=807[docker-deploy].  The file begins
`"Add convenience for users to containerize and deploy their Angular application via Docker. …”`.  And then, a
2x4 materialized and bounced off my head: _Huh, maybe I can't simply dismiss this Docker thing as something
beyond the pale of JavaScript/frontend and my so-called expertise._ This collection (aka directory, aka _barrel_) is
aimed at gaining some experience with link:http://docker.com[docker].
