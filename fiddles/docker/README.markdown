docker
======

[Digging around in the angular-cli github repo recently I found an interesting 
markdown (*.md) file entitled “docker-deploy”](http://three-bradyhouse.rhcloud.com/?p=807).  The file begins 
`"Add convenience for users to containerize and deploy their Angular application via Docker. …”`.  And then, a 
2x4 materialized ... : _Huh, maybe I can't simply dismiss this Docker thing as something 
beyond the pale of JavaScript/frontend and my so-called expertise._ 

This collection (aka directory, aka _barrel_) is aimed at gaining some experience with [docker](http://docker.com). 
_Yah-dah, yah-dah, yah-dah ..._ kindle injection-- Karl Mathias and Sean P. Kane’s book 
[Docker: Up and Running](https://amzn.com/B00ZGRS4XM).  

Finally, if you are really following along, start with [bash fiddle #81](../bash/fiddle-0081-docker). It automates
the setup of the docker client and dependencies via home brew. For the _non-Mac challenged_, See the 
aforementioned text.
