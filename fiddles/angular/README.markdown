_Angular!_ Its ubiquitous.  Unfortunately, as primarily an "ExtJS" developer, I know nothing of _angular_.
This directory is dedicated to fiddles involving my exploration of the angular framework.


### Procedures

#### Create

[Angular](../angular) fiddles are created to simply run in the browser.  This means, the resulting sandbox can
be hosted using [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) or any type of vanilla web server
package. The contents of the sandbox is based entirely on the contents of the [template](template) directory.
To create a new angular fiddle, run the following command from the [scripts](../../scripts) directory like so:

    ./fiddle.sh "create" "angular2-cli" "fiddle-####-<Name>"

where:

    <Name> is the name of the new fiddle.

If everything is working correctly, you should see a stream of output that looks like this [sample create output](CREATE.markdown).
