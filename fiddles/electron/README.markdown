Electron
======

You can seemingly do everything in the browser using JavaScript (or some abstraction 
_aka framework_).  _But what about the desktop?_ Enter [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). This collection of fiddles
is dedicated to my exploration of electron.


### Book

As a starting point, I will be working through Adam Lynch's book [Developing an Electron Edge (Developing an edge Book 12)](https://amzn.com/B01G7TTKSK).


### Procedures

#### Create

[electron](../electron) fiddles are created based on the[electron-quick-start app](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start),
which available on github.  The create logic baked into the [fiddle.sh](../../scripts/fiddle.sh) script is based on 
[bash fiddle #86](../bash/fiddle-0086-Electron).  To create a new electron fiddle, run the following command from the 
[scripts](../../scripts) directory like so:

    ./fiddle.sh "create" "electron" "fiddle-####-<Name>"

where:

    <Name> is the name of the new fiddle.

If everything is working correctly, you should see a stream of output that looks like this [sample create output](CREATE.markdown).
