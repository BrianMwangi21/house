RxJS
======

This directory is dedicated to fiddles involving my exploration of the
[Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS)](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS).  For DOM manipulation (and
further practise), these fiddles utilize d3.  The template index.html file includes a reference to the
[3.5.16 version of d3 published on cdnjs](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/3.5.16/d3.js).
For fiddles exclusively involving d3, checkout my [d3 fiddle collection](../../d3).
