Chrome extensions are simply JavaScript / HTML / CSS.  In this directory, you will find my exploration into the development of Chrome extensions. 

To test out any of these fiddles, see the instructions published on the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted" target="_blank">Getting Started: Building a Chrome Extension</a>. 

**NOTE - you cannot use the master [fiddle.sh](../../scripts/fiddle.sh) script to test (or "start") these fiddles.**
