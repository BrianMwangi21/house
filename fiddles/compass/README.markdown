In my professional life (these days) I function as an "ExtJS SME". If you have ever explored the [ExtJS API pages](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0/6.0.0-classic/), you
will soon notice that every component includes a collection of "CSS Variables" and "CSS Mixins".  Unfortunately, Sencha doesn't provide much explanation of these features.
They seem to be aimed at developers with some prior knowledge of SASS and CSS.  Since I don't (yet) fall into this category, it feels like there is a whole facet of the framework
that I have yet to explore.  This collection of fiddles is therefore aimed at gaining some pre-requisite experience with SASS and Compass. And of course, there is a book.
In this case, I am working through Ben Frain's book [Sass and Compass for Designers (Community Experience Distilled)](http://amzn.com/B00M8PD926).
