In my professional life (these days) I function as an "ExtJS SME". If you have ever explored the 
[ExtJS API pages](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0/6.0.0-classic/), you will soon notice that every component includes 
a collection of "CSS Variables" and "CSS Mixins".  Unfortunately, Sencha doesn't provide much explanation of these features.
It as though they assume that all developers have some prior knowledge of (experience with) SASS, as though these 
features require no explanation.  Since I don't (yet) fall into this category, I feel like there is a whole facet of 
the framework that I have yet to explore.  This collection of fiddles is therefore aimed at gaining some pre-requisite 
experience with SASS and Compass. And of course, there is a book.  In this case, I am working through Ben Frain's book 
[Sass and Compass for Designers (Community Experience Distilled)](http://amzn.com/B00M8PD926).
