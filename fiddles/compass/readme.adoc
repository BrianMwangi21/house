= Compass

If you have ever explored the link:http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0/6.0.0-classic/[ExtJS API pages], you will soon notice
that every component includes a collection of "CSS Variables" and "CSS Mixins".  Unfortunately, Sencha doesn't provide
much explanation of these features. It as though they assume that all developers have some prior knowledge of
(experience with) SASS, as though these features require no explanation.  Since I don't (yet) fall into this category,
I feel like there is a whole facet of the framework that I have yet to explore.  This directory is dedicated to
exploration of this framework.  The `fiddle.sh` script can be used to extend or test drive this collection. The
following table outlines how.

In this case, I am working through Ben Frain's book link:http://amzn.com/B00M8PD926[Sass and Compass for Designers (Community Experience Distilled)].
