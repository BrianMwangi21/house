### Description

POC exploring how to create a unix socket based file watcher. When the target file changes, any telnet sessions 
subscribed to the server's unix socket are notified.  Note, this fiddle is based on the unix socket example given in 
Chapter 3 of Jim R. Wilson's book [Node.js the Right Way](http://amzn.com/1937785734).
