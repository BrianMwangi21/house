Node.js is a way around the pain and suffering required to implement a web service using Java
or .NET. Using Node.js, a developer can create a web service and consuming client application
using pure JavaScript. As per the source of all knowledge:  “Node.js is an open source,
cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js
applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X,
Microsoft Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NonStop and PCs … Node.js contains a built-in library
to allow applications to act as a Web server without software such as Apache HTTP Server or
IIS (Node.js, Wikipedia).”

In other words, if you are an aspiring web developer trying to decide on a platform (.NET, PHP, Java, Ruby),
then Node.js is the writing the wall.  The answer is JavaScript. Pre-_Node.js_, JavaScript was seen as purely
a necessary frontend evil.  It could be used to do cool things in the web browser, but it was beholding to
the backend for the heavy lifting.  The web server and database tiers were beyond its reach. Node.js
breaks this paradigm. Now JavaScript can be used for doing cool things on the backend as well.

I have added this section to begin my study of and practise with this technology.
