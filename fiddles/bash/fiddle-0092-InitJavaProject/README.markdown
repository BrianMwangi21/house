### Issue

[Issue #67](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/67)


### Description

Lately in _cubicle space/time_ I have been working with the [Spring JVM Framework](http://spring.io/).  Exposure to this framework has led me to wonder if `fiddle.sh` could be extended to provide Java based fiddle support. With that in mind, a bash POC is in order.  Specifically, can a simple Java project be initialized from the command line using Spring?
