Node Version Management

### Description

It's yet another _Because I Forget_ (BIF) fiddle.  In this case, it was a _node_ moment. Specifically, _How do you
upgrade to the latest version of node?_  An internet search led me to the requisite
[stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10075990/upgrading-node-js-to-latest-version).  This
script automates the steps discussed.
