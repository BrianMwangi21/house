= Bash

Its a Linux world. If you want to do something on the stack this usually means you will need to write
some type of shell script.  As with everything, practise makes perfect. This directory is
dedicated to fiddles involving bash (sh, ksh, csh ... etc).  The `fiddle.sh` script can be
used to extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.
