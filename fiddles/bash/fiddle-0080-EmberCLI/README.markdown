### Title

Ember CLI


### Creation Date

05-18-16


### Location

Angular 2 Summit @ Chicago


### Description

Per the conference I attended this week, the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) is based on the ember CLI.  This
bags the question:  _What is ember and its magical CLI_?  And also, _Why not just use ember then?_  This POC is step
towards answering the obvious. It automates the install of the ember-cli. It invokes the cli to create and subsequently
_start_ a simple app.
