### Description

It's yet another _Because I Forgot_ (BIF) fiddle.  In this case the question, _How do you search for a sub-directory (or file) and verify that only one match is found?_. The
impetus for this question was a desire to make the fiddle.sh script's combine, refactor ... etc. scripts work when only the fiddle number (or other unique criteria) is provided.
Another words, I want to be able to enter "script.sh combine svg 22" in order to resemble the app.js file in the "/fiddles/svg/fiddle-0022-Spirograph" directory.  Additionally,
for this bash script, I also created a secondary test.sh, to test the output generated by the script depending on the input parameters... Question: _Is there such a thing a
bash testing framework?_
