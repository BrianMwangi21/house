### Description

It's yet another _Because I Forget_ (BIF) fiddle.  In this case, it was a _bower_ moment. Specifically, _How do you
upgrade to the latest version of bower or determine if the current version of bower is the latest?_
An internet search led me to the [npm bower-update page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower-update).  This
script automates the steps discussed.
