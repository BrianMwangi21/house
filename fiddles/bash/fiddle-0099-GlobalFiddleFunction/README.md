### Title

Global Fiddle Function


### Creation Date

### Issue

[Issue #232](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/232)


### Description

I am sick of having to navigate to the scripts directory every time I want to execute fiddle.sh.  How do I automate 
these steps using a globally defined `fiddle` function?  Assuming there is no learning curve obstruction, how do I 
then automate the installation (aka setup) of said function? Time for my favorite: an actual bash fiddle.
