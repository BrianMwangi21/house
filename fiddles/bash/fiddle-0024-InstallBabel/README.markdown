### Description

It's yet another _Because I Forgot_ (BIF) fiddle.  In this case, it was a _webstorm tooltip_ moment. In particular,
after changing **Languages & Frameworks | JavaScript | JavaScript language version** to ECMAScript 6, webstorm
kept displaying the message _Babel File Watcher available ..._. This led me to the
[Babel setup page](https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/#webstorm) and the npm babel install command, which I will
naturally forget.
