### Title

Git Amend Commit


### Creation Date

Chicago, IL


### Description

It's yet another _Because I Forget_ (BIF) fiddle.  In this case, I committed some code and fat fingered the
commit message. In order to correct, I had lookup how to change the git commit message.  This led me to a
[stack overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/179123/edit-an-incorrect-commit-message-in-git) and
necessary command, which I will naturally forget.
