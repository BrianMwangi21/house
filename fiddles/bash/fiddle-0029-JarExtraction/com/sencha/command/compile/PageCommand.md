This command processes a markup file as input and generates an output file with
certain sections rewritten.

If the `-name` option is specified, the dependency graph of all required files
is saved as a file set with that name (see also the `save` command).

If the `-name` option is not specified, all required files are instead written
to the "all-classes.js" file.
