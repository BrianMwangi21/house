This command performs image slicing and manipulation driven by the contents of
a JSON manifest file. The manifest file contains an array of image area
definitions that further contain a set of "slices" to make.

This file and the corresponding image are typically produced for a Theme as
part of the theme package build. For details on this process, consult this
guide:
