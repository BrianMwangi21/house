Forces (re)synchronization with a remote repository catalog. Normally this is
done periodically and does not need to be manually synchronized. This command
may be needed if there something known to have been added to a remote repo but
has not yet shown up in the catalog on this machine.

    sencha repo sync someremote

To resynchronize with all remote repositories:

    sencha repo sync
