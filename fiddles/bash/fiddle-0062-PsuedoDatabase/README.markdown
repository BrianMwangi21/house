### Description

The scripts directory is exploding.  Every time I decide to investigate another framework, I have define yet another
templating script and manually update of each of the existing scripts.  Per the changelog --

  1. Added [fiddles/angular2](fiddles/angular2)
        * Reflected changes:
            1.  Added [scripts/fiddle-angular2.sh](scripts/fiddle-angular2.sh)
            2.  Updated [scripts/fiddle-create.sh](scripts/fiddle-create.sh)
            3.  Updated [scripts/fiddle-index.sh](scripts/fiddle-index.sh)
            4.  Updated [scripts/fiddle-list.sh](scripts/fiddle-list.sh)
            5.  Updated [scripts/fiddle-refactor.sh](scripts/fiddle-refactor.sh)
            6.  Updated [scripts/fiddle-delete.sh](scripts/fiddle-delete.sh)
            7.  Updated [scripts/fiddle-fork.sh](scripts/fiddle-fork.sh)
            8.  Updated [scripts/fiddle-start.sh](scripts/fiddle-start.sh)

I am sick of having to do this. With that in mind, before I add more frameworks (d3, react, redux ... etc.)
I have to come up with strategy for quickly adding new frameworks.  I need a __BASH Database__.  Hence this fiddle.


### Procedure

Execute the [test.sh](test.sh) script to see functions defined in the [script.sh](script.sh) script in action.
