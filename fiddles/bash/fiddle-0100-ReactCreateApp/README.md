React Create App


### Creation Date

### Issue

[Issue 238](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/238)


### Description

I need to start `fiddling` with react already. So its time to add react fiddle support.  Similar to all fiddle.sh 
enhancements, step 1 begins with a bash fiddle that messes with the fiddle.sh script itself.  This allows the 
enhancement to be developed and tested prior to integrating into the master script. The create functionality for
react should utilize the `npx create-react-app ...` command -- see [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The other eight fiddle commands should follow the pattern established by `angular2-cli` fiddle support.
