three
======

Before you can build a website using [three.js](http://threejs.org/), you have to understand the API.  Based on books, research, and trial and error, the best approach I have found is [js fiddle] (http://jsfiddle.net/).  If I am unfamiliar with or (simply) donâ€™t understand a specific piece of the framework,
then step one is to build and publish a fiddle (or fiddles) until it makes sense.  Each of the following sub-directories corresponds to stand alone application that *fiddles* with a specific piece of the three.js framework.
