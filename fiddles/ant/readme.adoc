= ANT

__ANT__ (Another Neat Tool) is ubiquitous to Java types. If you want to do something on the stack involving Java,
this usually means you will need to write some type of ANT build.xml file.  As with everything, practise makes perfect.
This directory is dedicated to fiddles involving ANT.  On another front, (I think/believe) understanding ANT is fundamental to
understanding the underpinnings of the Sencha CMD build tool.  link:docs.sencha.com/cmd/6.x/advanced_cmd/cmd_ant.html[Sencha CMD]
supports ANT based automation.  This directory is dedicated to fiddles involving my exploration of ANT. The `fiddle.sh`
script can be used to extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.
