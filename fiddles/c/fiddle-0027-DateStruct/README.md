[Issue 126](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/126)


### Description

Create a fiddle based on Program 9.1 from Stephen Kochan's book Programming in C (Developer's Library) 4th Edition.  This program introduces custom data structures in order to save and manipulate dates.

### Use Case

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "0027"
    
This should produce the following output:

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    FIDDLE.SH
    FIDDLE-START.SH
    ├────STARTSERVER
    ├────GCCSTART
    ├────INVOKING EXECUTABLE
    
    datastructure started
    
    Today's date is 12/28/16.
    
    datastructure ended
