### Issue

[Issue 97](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/97)


### Description

Create a fiddle based on Program 5.7 from Stephen Kochan's book [Programming in C (Developer's Library) 4th Edition](http://a.co/1QJ9MDN).  This program calculates the _Greatest Common Divisor_ (GCD) of any two non-negative number.  It also demonstrates the use of a simple while loop.


### Use Case

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "0007"
    
This should produce the following output:

    H o u s e
    oooooooooooo  o8o        .o8        .o8  oooo
     888       8  `"'        888        888   888
     888         oooo   .oooo888   .oooo888   888   .ooooo.
     888oooo8     888  d88   888  d88   888   888  d88   88b
     888          888  888   888  888   888   888  888ooo888
     888          888  888   888  888   888   888  888    .o
