### Title

Recursive Functions


### Creation Date

### Location

Chicago, IL


### Issue

[Issue 121](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/121)


### Description

Create a fiddle based on Program 8.16 from Stephen Kochan's book Programming in C (Developer's Library) 4th Edition.  This program demonstrates to calculate the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of a given number using a recursive function.


### Use Case

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "0026"
    
This should produce the following output:

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    FIDDLE.SH
    FIDDLE-START.SH
    ├────STARTSERVER
    ├────GCCSTART
    ├────INVOKING EXECUTABLE
    
    recursivefunctions started
    
    0! = 1
    1! = 1
    2! = 2
    3! = 6
    4! = 24
    5! = 120
    6! = 720
    7! = 5040
    8! = 40320
    9! = 362880
    10! = 3628800
