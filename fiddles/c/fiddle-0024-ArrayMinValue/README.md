[Issue 118](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/118)


### Description

Create a fiddle based on Program 8.9 from Stephen Kochan's book Programming in C (Developer's Library) 4th Edition.  This program further introduces functions by exploring how to find the minimum value in an array of integers.


### Use Case

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "0024"
    
This should produce the following output:

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    FIDDLE.SH
    FIDDLE-START.SH
    ├────STARTSERVER
    ├────GCCSTART
    ├────INVOKING EXECUTABLE
    Enter 10 scores
    
Enter the values `12 23 34 55 67 7 9 1 22 0`.  This should produce the following result.

    Minimum score is 0
