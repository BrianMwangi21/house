### Issue

[Issue 134](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/134)


### Description

Create a fiddle based on Program 10.7 from Stephen Kochan's book Programming in C (Developer's Library) 4th Edition.  This program demonstrates how to create a function that counts the number of words in a given string (aka sentence).


### Use Case

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "0033"
    
This should produce the following output:

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    FIDDLE.SH
    FIDDLE-START.SH
    ├────STARTSERVER
    ├────GCCSTART
    ├────INVOKING EXECUTABLE
    
    wordcount started
    
    Well, here goes. - words = 3
    And here we go... again - words = 5
    
    wordcount ended
