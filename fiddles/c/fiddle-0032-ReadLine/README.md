### Issue

[Issue 133](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/133)


### Description

Create a fiddle based on Program 10.6 from Stephen Kochan's book Programming in C (Developer's Library) 4th Edition.  This program demonstrates how to create a `readLine` function using the `getchar` function to populate a char array.



### Use Case

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "0032"
    
This should produce the following output:

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    FIDDLE.SH
    FIDDLE-START.SH
    ├────STARTSERVER
    ├────GCCSTART
    ├────INVOKING EXECUTABLE
    
    readline started
    
Enter the sentence `I am bored and confused....` and press enter.  This should produce the following result.
    
    I am bored and confused....
