### Issue

[Issue ??](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/??)


### Description

C fiddle template test.  This is a smoke test of the [fiddle.sh](../../scripts/fiddle.sh) script to verify that
it supports create/delete/refactor/list functionality for "c" based POC's aka fiddles. This is only a test.


### Use Case

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "{{FiddleId}}"
    
This should produce the following output:

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    FIDDLE.SH
    FIDDLE-START.SH
    ├────STARTSERVER
    ├────GCCSTART
    ├────INVOKING EXECUTABLE
    
    {{Title}} started
    
    {{Title}} ended
