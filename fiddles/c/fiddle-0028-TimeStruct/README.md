### Issue

[Issue 127](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/127)


### Description

Create a fiddle based on Program 9.5 from Stephen Kochan's book Programming in C (Developer's Library) 4th Edition.  This program further introduces custom data structures in order to save and manipulate time.


### Use Case

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "0028"
    
This should produce the following output:

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    FIDDLE.SH
    FIDDLE-START.SH
    ├────STARTSERVER
    ├────GCCSTART
    ├────INVOKING EXECUTABLE
    
    timestruct started
    
    Enter the time (hh:mm:ss):
    
Enter `01:00:00` and press [enter].

    Enter the time (hh:mm:ss): 01:00:00
    Updated time is 01:00:01
    
    timestruct ended
