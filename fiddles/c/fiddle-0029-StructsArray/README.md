### Issue

[Issue 129](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/129)


### Description

Create a fiddle based on Program 9.6 from Stephen Kochan's book Programming in C (Developer's Library) 4th Edition.  This program further introduces custom data structures by demonstrating how to create an array of `structs`.


### Use Case

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "0029"
    
This should produce the following output:

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    FIDDLE.SH
    FIDDLE-START.SH
    ├────STARTSERVER
    ├────GCCSTART
    ├────INVOKING EXECUTABLE
    
    structsarray started
    
    11:59:59 - 12:00:00
    12:00:00 - 12:00:01
    01:29:59 - 01:30:00
    23:59:59 - 00:00:00
    19:12:27 - 19:12:28
    
    structsarray ended
