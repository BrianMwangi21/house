Ember
======

Recently, a developer said to me _ExtJS is so legacy ..._.  After holstering my laughter, I ended the IM
thread with a simple _ok_. Afterwards, I thought: _If ExtJS is _legacy_ what does that make Ember? pre-historic_.
I am not sure.  The truth is (_me thinks_), there is so no such thing as _legacy_ in the age of the transpiler.  Its all
JavaScript.  The question is _What do you prefer?_ Ember (like ExtJS or Angular) ultimately transpile
JavaScript.  The _ember-evangelical_ answer goes something like this _kindle says what!_:

     Ember.js is a highly opinionated framework and takes a lot of inspiration from the Ruby on Rails conventions
     over configuration philosophy.  Convention over configuration, also known as coding by conventions, is
     a design philosophy wherein things work as expected, provided they follow a common set of guidelines.

This collection explores the [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) framework.

As a starting point, I worked through the examples outlined by Suchit Puri in his book  __[Ember.js Web Development with Ember CLI](https://amzn.com/B00YEVZ6WI)__.
