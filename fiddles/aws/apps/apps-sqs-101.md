## What is SQS?

Amazon SQS is a web service that gives you access to a message queue that can be used to store messages while
waiting for a computer to process them.  It is a distributed queue system that enables web service applications
to quickly and reliably queue messages that one component in the application generates to be consumed by another
component. A queue is a temporary repository for messages that are awaiting processing.
