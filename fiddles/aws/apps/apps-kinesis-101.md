## What is Streaming data?

`Streaming data` is data generated continuously by thousand of data sources, which typically send in the data records
simultaneously, and in small sizes (order of Kilobytes). This could be:

* Purchases from online stores (aka amazon.com)
* Stock Prices
* Game data (as gamers play)
* Social network data
* Geospatial data (think uber.com)
* iOT sensor data


## Given that context, what is Kinesis?

Kinesis is a platform on AWS to send streaming data too. Kinesis makes it easy to load and analyze streaming data. It
also provides the ability for you to build your own custom applications for your business needs.  There are three
core Kinesis services.


### Kinesis Streams

* Kinesis streams consist of shards
  * 5 transactions per second for reads, up to a maximum total data read rate of 2 MBs per second and up to 1,000
    records per second for writes, up to a maximum total data write rate of 1 MB per second (including partition keys)
* The data capacity of your stream is a function of the number of shards that you specify for the stream. The total
  capacity of the stream  is the sum of the capacities of its shards

### Kinesis Firehose

Firehose simplifies the architecture through automation. It eliminates the need shard, consumers and
data retention policies. There are two configuration options.


### Redshift Configuration

### Kinesis Analytics

Analytics allows you to run SQL types queries against data processed via Streams or Firehose.  The results of these
queries can then be processed (or stored) using other AWS services.

## Exam Tips

What did we learn?

* Know the difference between Streams and Firehose. You will be given scenario questions and you must choose the most
  relevant service
* Understand at a high level what Kinesis Analytics is
