## What is a VPC?

Think of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) as a virtual data center in the cloud. The service lets you provision a 
logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud where you can launch AWS resources
in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, 
including selection your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and
network gateways.

You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. For example, you can
create a public-facing subnet for your webservers that has access to the Internet, and place your backend 
systems such as databases or application servers in a private-facing subnet with no Internet access. You can
leverage multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help
control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet.

Additionally, you can create a Hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your corporate 
datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS cloud as an extension of your corporate datacenter.

In this cloud guru screen-scrape, a `virtual network` has 4 navigational parts:  

1.  router
2.  route table
3.  Network `Access Control List` (ACL)
4.  Security Group

For a Public EC2 Instances, the router is accessed via an Internet Gateway. Private instances require a VPN 
connection.   


## IP Address Ranges

Amazon provides support for up to 16,777,216 IP addresses within a single VPC.  The IP range is defined based
on the prefixing strategy that you select for your IP addresses.  For example:

* `10/8 prefix` - (high) 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
* `172.16/2 prefix` - (medium) 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
* `192.168/16 prefix` - (small) 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
*  ...

Checkout [cidr.xyz](http://cidr.xyz/) to simulate a given strategy. _Note - entering 8 gives you the maximum. entering
32 gives you the minimum._


## What can you do with a VPC?

* Launch instances into a subnet (or AZ) of your choosing
* Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet
* Configure route tables between subnets
* Create an Internet gateway and attach it to our VPC
* Much better security control over your AWS resources
* Instance security groups
* Subnet network access control lists (ACLS)


## Default vs Custom VPC's

What's the difference?

* Default VPC's are user friendly, allowing you to immediately deploy EC2 instances
* All subnets in a Default VPC have a route out to the internet-- ie no private subnets
* Each EC2 instance has both a public and private IP address


## VPC Peering

* Allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses
* Instances behave as if they were on the same private network
* You can peer VPC's with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPCs in the same account

### VPC Transitive Peering

Peering is in a star configuration--i.e. point-to-point. Connection are __not__ transitive. In other words,
`If A connects to B and A connects to C, then B connects to C`, is __not__ true.  For VPC B to connect to VPC C,
an explicit connection between B and C is required.


## Exam Tips

What did we learn?

* Think of a VPC as a logical datacenter in AWS
* Consists of IGWs (or Virtual Private Gateways), Route Tables, Network Access Control Lists, Subnets,
  and Security Groups
* 1 Subnet = 1 Availability Zone
* Security Groups are Stateful; Network Access Control Lists are Stateless. `Huh?` Where state ='s 
  inbound vs outbound configuration. For example, if you open a port on a Security Group, you 
  automatically get both inbound and outbound traffic. To establish a similar configuration 
  using a Network Access Control List, you must explicit enable inbound and outbound 
  traffic on that port.
* No TRANSITIVE PEERING
    
    
## Review Questions

1.  Can security groups span subnets?
2.  Can a subnet span availability zones?    
3.  Can you have multiple VPCs within a region? If so, what is the `soft limit`?
4.  In order to setup a VPC with exactly 16 IP addresses, what strategy would you use?
5.  How many internet gateways can you have per VPC?
6.  How do you connect 2 VPC's?
7.  Can you peer connect VPC under different AWS Accounts?
8.  Are VPC peer connections transitive?
