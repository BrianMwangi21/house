## What are VPC Flow logs?

VPC Flow logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from 
your network interface in your VPC. Flow log data is stored using Amazon CloudWatch logs.  After you've 
created a flow log, you can view and retrieve data in the Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

Flow logs can be created at 3 levels:

* VPC 
* Subnet
* Network Interface Level


## Exam Tips

What did we learn?

* You cannot enable flow logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account
* You cannot tag a flow log
* After you created a flow log, you cannot change its configuration; for example you can't associate a 
  different IAM role with the flow log
* Not all IP Traffic is monitored, including:
  * Traffic generated by instances when they contact the Amazon DNS server. _Note - If you use your own DNS server, then
    all traffic to that DNS server is logged_
  * Traffic generated by a Windows instance for Amazon Windows license activation 
  * Traffic to and from 169.254.169.254 for instance metadata
  * DHCP traffic
  * Traffic to the reserved IP address for the default router
