Ugly Scenario Question: "You are hosting a company website on some EC2 web servers in your VPC. Users of the 
    website must log into the site which then authenticates against the companies active directory servers which
    are based on site at the companies head quarters. Your VPC is connected to your company's HQ via secure
    IPSEC VPN. Once logged in the user can only have access to their own S3 bucket. How do you set this up?" What
    is the gory detail solution? (9)
(1) Employee enters their username / password; (2) The application calls an Identity Broker, which captures the
    username and password; (3) The identity broker uses the organization's LDAP directory to validate the employee's
    identity; (4) The Identity Broker calls the new `GetFederationToken` function using IAM credentials. The call
    must include an IAM policy and duration (1 to 36 hours), along with a policy that specifies the permissions
    to be granted to the temporary security credentials; (5) The STS confirms the policy of the IAM user making the
    call to `GetFederationToken` gives permission to create new tokens and then returns four values to the 
    application: (a) Access Key, (b) Secret Key, (c) Token, and (d) Duration (Token's lifetime); (6) The identity
    Broker returns the temporary security credentials to the reporting application; (7) The data storage application
    uses the temporary security credentials (including the token) to make requests to Amazon S3; (8) Amazon
    S3 uses IAM to verify that the credentials allow the requested operation on the given S3 bucket and key; 
    (9) IAM provides S3 with the go-ahead to perform the requested operation.

    solution? (3)
(1) Develop an Identity Broker to communicate with LDAP and AWS; (2) Identity Broker always authenticates with
    LDAP first THEN with AWS STS; (3) Application then gets temporary access to AWS resources

(1) Develop an Identity Broker to communicate with LDAP and AWS STS; (2) Identity Broker always authenticates
    with LDAP first, gets an IAM role associated with a user; (3) Application then authenticates with STS and assumes
    that IAM role; (4) The application uses that IAM role to interact with S3
