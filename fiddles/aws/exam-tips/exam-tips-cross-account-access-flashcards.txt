Why would a developer setup multiple AWS accounts?
They establish a dedicated account for `production` resources and a separate dedicated account for `non-production` 
    resources.

What does `Cross Account Access` simplify?
Cross account access makes it easier for you to work productively within a multi-account (or multi-role) AWS
    environment by making it easy for you to switch roles within the AWS Management Console. You can now sign into the
    console using your IAM user name and then switch the console to manage another account without having to 
    enter (or remember) another user name and password.

What type of policy is required to enable cross account access?
Inline Policy
