What infrastructure is used by AWS to create a VPC peering connection? What is the benefit?
AWS uses the existing infrastructure of a VPC to create a VPC peering connection. It is neither a gateway nor 
    a VPN connection, and does not rely on a separate piece of physical hardware. There is no single point of failure
    for communication or a bandwidth bottleneck.

Exam Tips

What is `Transitive Peering`? Is it supported?
If A is peered to B and B is peered to C, then A is peered C; No
Exam Tips

What are the 3 VPC Peering Limitations?
(1) You cannot create a VPC peering connection between VPCs that have matching or overlapping CIDR blocks;
