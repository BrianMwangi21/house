= Amazon Web Services

I finally finished my bachelor's degree in 2015.  At 40 I graduated Cum Laude from the Illinois Institute of
Technology's Information and Technology Management program.  The achievement took nearly eight years of
my life, cost nearly 80K and ultimately played a major role in destroying my marriage.  In hind sight, I wish I
would have just spent that time (and money) studying and mastering AWS.  Anyway, life goes on and here we are--
time to make-up for lost time. This directory is dedicated to my notes and `fiddles` involving AWS.  At the outset,
this just means markdown files written while watching lectures on link:http://acloud.guru[acloud.guru].
