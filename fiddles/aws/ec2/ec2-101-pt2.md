Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) 101 - Part 2
======

## What is EBS?

Disks that you attach to virtual machines.  Amazon `Elastic Block Storage (EBS)` allows you to create storage volumes 
and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a 
database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. EBS volumes are placed in a specific 
Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component--
aka storage array.  This replication occurs within the same zone.


## EBS Volume Types

There are currently five different types, which are either `Hard Disk Drive (HDD)` (aka `magnetic`) or
`Solid State Drive (SSD)` volumes.


### SSD Types


#### General Purpose SSD (GP2)

* General purpose, `Solid State Drive (SSD)`
* Balance both price and performance
* Ratio of 3 `Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS)` per GB with up to 10,000 IOPS
* Offers the ability to burst up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes 3334 GB and above


#### Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)

* Designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases
* Use if your need more than 10,000 IOPS
* Can provision up to 20,000 IOPS per volume
 

### Magnetic (HDD)


#### Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)

* Big data
* Use Cases: data warehouse, log processing
* Intended for large amounts of sequential data
* **Cannot be a boot device**


#### Cold HDD (SC1)

* Cheapest option
* Intended for infrequently accessed workloads
* Use Cases: File Server
* **Cannot be a boot device**


#### Magnetic Standard

* Cheapest option for a boot devices
* Ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently
* Intended for applications where the lowest storage cost is important

## EC2 Exam Tips

* Know the difference between different pricing models
  * On Demand
  * Spot
  * Reserved 
  * Dedicated Hosts
* Remember with spot instances
  * If you terminate the instance, you pay for the hour
  * If AWS terminates the spot instance, you get the hour it was terminated in for free
* EBS consists of
  * SSD, General Purpose - GP2 - (Up to 10,000 IOPS)
  * SSD, Provisioned IOPS - IO1 - (More than 10,000 IOPS)
  * HDD, Throughput Optimized - ST1 - frequently accessed workloads
  * HDD, Cold - SC1 - less frequently accessed data
  * HDD, Magnetic - Standard - cheap, infrequently accessed storage
* **You cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS**
* EC2 instance types - DR MCGIF PX
  * `D` - for Density
  * `R` - for RAM
  * `M` - for Main choice -- aka general purpose apps
  * `C` - for Compute
  * `G` - for Graphics
  * `I` - for IOPS
  * `F` - for FPGA
  * `T` - for T2 Micro -- aka cheap general purpose
  * `P` - for Pics -- aka Graphics
  * `X` - for Extreme Memory
