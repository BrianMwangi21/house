Using Polly To Pass Your Exam Lab (Part 2)
======

This is a `2 parter`.  In [part 1](ec2-using-polly-lab-pt1.md), 3 Lambda functions were created.  Two functions are used
to read and write to a DynamoDB table.  The third function is used to invoke the Polly service to generate MP3 files 
and write (or save) them to an S3 bucket.

In part 2, the API Gateway service is used to establish the API pieces necessary to enable a static website hosted in 
an S3 bucket to communicate with the Lambda functions created in part 1.  

*Note, although this is a great lab for gaining experience with AWS, it is beyond the scope of the Exam.  In other 
words, there are no Exam Tips (or Exam related notes) resulting from the the completion of this lab.*
