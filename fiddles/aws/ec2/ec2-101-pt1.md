## What is EC2?

`Virtual machines in the cloud.` Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizeable compute 
capacity in the cloud. It reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you 
to quickly scale capacity both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

The service effectively shifts the economics of computing to an `a la carte` paradigm.  You simply pay for the
capacity you use. It provides the tools to build failure resilient applications and avoid common failure scenarios.


## Pricing Models

The service offers four `pricing models`.


### On Demand

* fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitments
  * Note - pricing by the second is a new feature. Only linux instances can be priced by the second. Windows instances
    are still only priced by the hour
* Users that want low cost and flexibility of EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
* Applications with short term, spiky or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
* Applications being developed or tested on EC2 for the first time


### Reserved
    
* 1 - 3 year term contract
* Intended for applications with steady state and predictable usage that require specific amount of capacity
* Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
* For those studying for the Professional exams, there are 3 different types of reserved instances (RI) options: 
  1.  `Standard RI's` - up to 75% off on demand
  2.  `Convertible RI's` - up to 45% off on demand. Offers the capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as
      the exchange results in the creation of RI's of equal or greater value. For example you could change the RI from
      linux to windows
  3.  `Scheduled RI's` - (very new). these RI's are available to launch within a configurable schedule. This option 
      allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a 
      fraction of a day, week, or a month


### Spot

* Market price bid. You lock in a price you want to pay. When the market price of the capacity you need 
  hits that price, it becomes available
* Intended for applications with flexible end and start times that are only feasible at very low compute prices
* Another `Use Case` is for users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity
* Example customers, are insurance companies that need to do big data processing and can wait until 3 AM on Saturday
  to minimize the price of the job
  
  
### Dedicated Host

* Physical dedicated EC2 server 
* Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
* Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
* Can be purchased On-Demand (hourly)
* Can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price


## EC2 Instance Types

* `Family` - There are more being added all the time. Last year there were seven. Now there are ten. Families are
  organized (and named) based on their purpose. `D2` - the `D` stands for `density` or file servers. The `2` just
  means second generation. It used to be `D1`. You didn't know them all but it helps to have some understanding
  of what the different families are
  * `D` - density
  * `R` - RAM; memory optimized
  * `M` - think `main choice` general purpose
  * `C` - CPU; compute optimized
  * `G` - graphics
  * `I` - interface options (IOPs); high speed storage
  * `F` - (brand new) field programming -- google "FPGA"
  * `T` - low cost general purpose
  * `P` - graphics and general purpose -- machine learning
  * `X` - extreme RAM; extreme memory optimization
* How to Remember all the families: `Dr Mc GIFT PX`
