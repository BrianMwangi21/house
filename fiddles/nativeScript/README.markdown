nativeScript
======

I discovered (or heard about) nativeScript on a recent javaScript jabber podcast.  NativeScript is a
framework for developing cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript.  This directory is dedicated
to my exploration of this framework.  Each directory corresponds to separate nativeScript app.
