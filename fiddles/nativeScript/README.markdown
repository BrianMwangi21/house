nativeScript
======

I discovered (or heard about) nativeScript on a recent javaScript jabber podcast.  NativeScript is a
framework for developing cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript.  This directory is dedicated
to my exploration of this framework.  Each directory corresponds to separate mobile app.

**NOTE - the creation and maintenance of this collection is independent of the the master [fiddle.sh](../../scripts/fiddle.sh) script.**
