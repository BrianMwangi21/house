### Description

Fiddle exploring how to translate (or port) an existing android app to nativeScript.  More specifically, I
recently published my first _(hello world)_ app on google play ~ [Puzz App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fp.itm455.iit.com.puzzler).
In this fiddle I wanted to attempt to create a nativeScript version of this simple little app.

Note, the source code for Puzz is actually available on github @ [https://github.com/bradyhouse/ITM455](https://github.com/bradyhouse/ITM455/tree/master/FP).
