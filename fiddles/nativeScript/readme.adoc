= NativeScript

NativeScript is a framework for developing cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript.  This directory is dedicated
to exploration of this framework.  Each directory corresponds to separate mobile app.  The `fiddle.sh` script
can be used to extend or test drive this collection. The following tables outlines how.

== Machine Specific Configuration

Use the link:../../scripts/bin/nativescript/.nativescriptrc[scripts/bin/nativescript/.nativescriptrc] file to configure machine specific variables.


== Enabling Angular2 Templating

`fiddle.sh` includes logic to initialize new nativeScript fiddles using _just JavaScript_ or Angular2 (aka _transpiled typeScript_)
By default, JavaScript is enabled. This means, fiddles are initialized using the `nativescript create ...` command.
In my experience, this approach is faster and cleaner. That said, if you want get your feet wet with Angular2 and typeScript,
then you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Open the link:../../scripts/bin/nativescript/.nativescriptrc[scripts/bin/nativescript/.nativescriptrc] file
2. Change the `__TEMPLATE_TYPE__` variable from `js` to `ng2`

Once this change is made, `fiddle.sh` will initialize new nativeScript fiddles using the link:https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular2-seed-advanced.git[Angular2 Advanced Seeder] repo.
