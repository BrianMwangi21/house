All modern browser support scalar vector graphics (SVG) markup.  _What, what, what?_
Consult [the source of all knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) and then
proceed directly to the bookstore (aka Amazon).  I am currently reading
a book by David Dailey, Jon Frost and Domenico Strazzullo entitled
[Building Web Applications with SVG (Developer Reference)](http://amzn.com/0735660123).  This directory
contains fiddles inspired by this text.
