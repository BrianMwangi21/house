= Javac

Increasingly, I am finding I need the ability to create a simple java based command line app
that explores a specific feature of java and/or single library without involving a full blown IDE or Maven repo.
The Java fiddle collection is aimed at gradle/Maven/Spring. It is therefore over kill in this regard.
For instance, if you simply want to try something with apache's http library  or play with a Java 8 Lambda
function, then creating a full-blown Spring based end point is beyond the pale.  The `fiddle.sh` script can be used to
extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.
