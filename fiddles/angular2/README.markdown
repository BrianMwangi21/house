angular2
======

_Angular?_ No, now its: _Angular2!_  Its ubiquitous. Unfortunately, as primarily an "ExtJS" developer, I know nothing of _Angular_ or
now _Angular2_.  This directory is dedicated to fiddles involving my exploration of version 2 of the Angular framework. As
starting point, I will work through the examples outlined by Felipe Coury (et al) in the book **ng-book 2 The Complete Book of AngularJS 2**.
This book, in its pre-release version, is available online @ [https://gitter.im/ng-book/ng-book](https://gitter.im/ng-book/ng-book).
