extjs6
======

If you are new to ExtJS, I would recommend starting with my [ExtJS 5](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/tree/master/fiddles/extjs5) fiddles. ExtJS 5.1 is now
open source and publicly available via the cache fly CDN.  This means all my version 5 fiddles can be started
locally simply using the [fiddle.sh](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/tree/master/scripts/fiddle.sh) script.  ExtJS 6
is only available via sencha's proprietary CDN.  This means before any of the fiddle can load the required libraries, 
you must first connect to [Sencha Fiddle](https://fiddle.sencha.com/#home).  This will make the sencha CDN temporarily 
available allowing the fiddles to startup.
