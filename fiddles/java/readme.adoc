= Java


Having a .NET and C# background (5+ years), I really have little patience for Java. However, professionally it is
becoming a necessary evil.  As with everything, practise makes perfect.  This directory is dedicated to fiddles
involving my exploration of link:http://spring.io/[Java Spring].  As a starting point, I will be working
through the examples outlined in Ludovic Dewailly's book link:https://amzn.com/B0148S9GV8[Building a RESTful Web Service with Spring].
The `fiddle.sh` script can be used to extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.
