Java
======

Having a .NET and C# background (5+ years), I really have little patience for Java. However, professionally it is
becoming a necessary evil.  As with everything, practise makes perfect.  This directory is dedicated to fiddles
involving my exploration of the new features of Java 8.

**Note - at the outset I have not decided how I want to standardize the creation of new Java fiddles.
In other words, the organization of this directory and code may change.**
