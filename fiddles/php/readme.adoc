= PHP

Before you can build a website using the Personal Home Page (PHP) language, you have to understand PHP.  
Based on books, research, and trial and error, the best approach I have found is to _fiddle_.  If I am unfamiliar 
with or (simply) donâ€™t understand a specific piece of the language, then step one is to build a fiddle (or fiddles) 
until it makes sense.  This directory is dedicated to exploration of this framework.  The `fiddle.sh` script can be used
to extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.
