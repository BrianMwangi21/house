php
======

Before you can build a website using the Personal Home Page (PHP) language, you have to understand PHP.  
Based on books, research, and trial and error, the best approach I have found is to _fiddle_.  If I am unfamiliar 
with or (simply) donâ€™t understand a specific piece of the language, then step one is to build a fiddle (or fiddles) 
until it makes sense.  Each of the following sub-directories corresponds to stand alone application that *fiddles* 
with a specific piece of PHP.


### Using fiddle.sh ...

#### Create

_TBW_

    fiddle.sh "create" "php" "fiddle-####-<name>"

where:

    <Name> is the name of the new fiddle/poc.
