As a JavaScript developer, much of my time is spent researching and attempting to master different frameworks.
In an attempt to capture this research I have developed a "house" repository.  If everything begins in the house,
then (perhaps) the "house always wins". This repository has become my research starting point. Essentially, it is
a collection of bash scripts and framework specific prototypes (or fiddles).  The bash scripts maintained
in the [scripts](scripts) directory are a work in progress. They are used for command line boiler plating
and automation.

* To learn about my latest changes check out the detailed [change log](CHANGELOG.markdown)
* To get started using my fiddles, checkout the [fiddles readme](fiddles)
* Finally, to learn more about me and what I am up to these days checkout [bradyhouse.io](http://bradyhouse.io)
