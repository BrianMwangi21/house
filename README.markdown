As a JavaScript developer, much of my time is spent researching and attempting to master different frameworks.
I have developed a "house" repository, in an attempt to capture this research. My thinking (hope) is driven by
the adage _if everything begins in the house, then (perhaps) the "house always wins"._ At the same time, to
learn _anything_, I am someone who has to build _something_.  The [scripts/fiddle.sh](scripts/fiddle.sh) is that thing.
Essentially, it is Command Line Interface (CLI) for quickly getting started with over 28 different frameworks and
languages.  At present, `fiddle.sh` supports:

*	[angular](fiddles/angular)
*	[angular2](fiddles/angular2)
*	[angular2-cli](fiddles/angular2-cli)
*	[angular2-seeder](fiddles/angular2-seeder)
*	[ant](fiddles/ant)
*	[aurelia](fiddles/aurelia)
*	[bash](fiddles/bash)
*	[chrome](fiddles/chrome)
*	[compass](fiddles/compass)
*	[d3](fiddles/d3)
*	[docker](fiddles/docker)
*	[dojo](fiddles/dojo)
*	[electron](fiddles/electron)
*	[ember](fiddles/ember)
*	[extjs5](fiddles/extjs5)
*	[extjs6](fiddles/extjs6)
*	[java](fiddles/java)
*	[jquery](fiddles/jquery)
*	[meteor](fiddles/meteor)
*	[nativeScript](fiddles/nativeScript)
*	[node](fiddles/node)
*	[php](fiddles/php)
*	[python](fiddles/python)
*	[rxjs](fiddles/rxjs)
*	[svg](fiddles/svg)
*	[three](fiddles/three)
*	[tween](fiddles/tween)
*	[typescript](fiddles/typescript)

To learn about my latest changes check out the detailed [change log](CHANGELOG.markdown).  To get started with
any of the frameworks listed, use the above links to explore the associated collection.  Finally, to learn more about
