meteor
=====

Collection of _sub-scripts_ used to create and/or manage [meteor](../../../fiddles/meteor) fiddles.  By "sub-script", I
mean these scripts contain functions referenced (or "sourced") by one more scripts in the parent [scripts](../..)
directory.  By convention, this is indicated by the "_*" prefix.  In other words, each script only contains functions and
cannot be executed by themselves.
