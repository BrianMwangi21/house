aurelia
=====

Collection of _sub-scripts_ used to create and/or manage [aurelia](../../../fiddles/aurelia) fiddles.  By "sub-script", I mean this scripts
contain functions referenced (or "sourced") by one more scripts in the parent [scripts](../..) directory.  By
convention, this is indicated by the "_*" prefix.  In other words, each script only contains functions and
cannot be executed by themselves.
