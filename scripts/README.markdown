scripts
=====

Collection of shell scripts developed to automate (or simplify) certain aspects of life.  The organization (or purpose) of each
script is implied by its name.  In particular --

*   **fiddle*** prefixed scripts can be used to "create" (or "fork") ../fiddles.  The "base" script
    of this collection is fiddle.sh.  In other words, if you want to create (or fork) a
    fiddle begin by running the fiddle.sh script.  This script requires certain command line parameters.
    Running it without these parameters will result in the usage details being displayed.
*   **mysql-(start/stop).sh** scripts can (as the names imply) be used to start or stop the mysql services
    on a Mac (or linux) machine that has mysql installed.
